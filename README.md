# Unfinished Project -- Anything can change at any time
# ZoraVM ( Zora Virtual Machine )

# Description
## ZVM is a virtual machine written for Zora Programming Language using its own assembly code for cross-platform compatibility.

# Features
- [] Assembly
- [] Cross-platform
- [] C Wrapper
- [] Compiler

# How will it work?
## ZVM will be able to run Zora Assembly Code.
## This will be compiled via GCC, Clang, or TCC for Bytecode.
## It will just use C as a wrapper to make a inbuilt runtime for Zora like the hardcoded code will just have change in instructions of array which will be executing the code.
## It will be able to run on any platform which supports C.
## It will be used to make a compiler for its own high level language.
