# ZoraVM ( Zora Virtual Machine )

# Description
## ZVM is a virtual machine written for Zora Programming Language using its own assembly code for cross-platform compatibility.

# Features
- [x] Universal Assembly Code
- [x] Cross-platform
- [x] Fast
- [x] Implemented in C
- [x] Reusable

# How will it work?
## ZVM will be written in C and will be compiled for each platform. It will be able to run Zora Assembly Code.
## This will be compiled via GCC, Clang, or TCC automatically through the Zora Compiler.
## It will just use C as a wrapper to make a inbuilt runtime for Zora like the hardcoded code will just have change in instructions of array which will be executing the code.
